## üß≠ Overview  
**Empress Chilliwack** is a custom WordPress website built to showcase a real estate development project in Chilliwack, British Columbia.

It served as a marketing and informational hub for prospective buyers and investors during the launch and sales phases.

## üí° Idea & Concept  
The goal was to build a high-quality, responsive site that promoted the unique value of the project and captured leads via CRM-integrated forms. It also needed to convey a strong narrative about the development, its location, amenities, and lifestyle.  

Target audiences included real estate buyers, investors, and the general public interested in pre-construction sales.
